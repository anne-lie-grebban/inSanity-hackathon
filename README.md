## Getting Started

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables:

**Automatic (recommended):**

```bash
./setup-env.sh
```

This creates `.env` files in `apps/studio` and `apps/web` from templates.

**Manual:**

Create `.env` files based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# apps/studio/.env
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production

# apps/web/.env
REACT_APP_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

> **Note:** `.env` files are ignored in git and will not be committed.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Development

Run all apps simultaneously:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Run only Studio:

```bash
pnpm dev:studio
```

Run only web:

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

### 4. Build

Build all apps:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Build specific app:

```bash
pnpm build:studio
pnpm build:web
```
